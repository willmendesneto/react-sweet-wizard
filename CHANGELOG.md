## [Unreleased][]

## [2.0.1][] - 2025-04-02

### Updated

- Improving internal types to remove `as` typescript usage

## [2.0.0][] - 2025-03-19

### Updated

- Improving `WizardStepperReducerState`, `Action`, `reducer` `initialState` and default values od `WizardStepperContext` types. All these types are now accepting generic values and the exposed methods can have their generic values applied.
- Better type safe: enforcing `useWizardContext` return to be `Readonly`
- Updating `setSteps` callback type to use the received generic type, if available.

### Added

- `<Step />` component can also have `id` as strings and numbers.

```tsx
...
const WizardSteps = () => (
  <Steps>
    <Step key="0" id="0">
      <div>
        <p>step 1</p>
      </div>
    </Step>
    {/* ðŸŽ‰ For better DX, `<Step />` component can also have `id` as strings ðŸŽ‰ */}
    <Step key="step2" id="step2">
      <div>
        <p>step 2</p>
      </div>
    </Step>
  </Steps>
);
```
